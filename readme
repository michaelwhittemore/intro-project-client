A simple project, built with the aim of learning the OpenTok JS SDK. Features video publishing and subscribing, screen-sharing, archiving, messaging via signaling, and HLS broadcasting. Built using vanilla JS and bootstrap on the client side and Node/Express on the server side. 

Users are assigned a role (either Idea or Investor) upon loading the page. A session is started whenever a user enters the video queue. They are matched with the first available opposite role in the queue who they have not previously	interacted with.
